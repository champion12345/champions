Dear Champion,
Enclosed is The Champion Code Manifesto. Champions are courageous. Champions find solutions. Champions work hard. Champions achieve goals. Champions are supporters, advocates and winners. Champions are all-round genius. I know and perhaps, I will convince you, or you will convince yourself, everybody is a champion. What we do in the everyday world connects us with the choices and opportunities to be champions. When we tell our life stories, we realise we are champions if, we want to be. However, being a champion is mysterious. When people know they, and everybody else, is a champion, their life changes. Experiences of being marginalised are replaced with experiences of being a champion. I would really appreciate knowing if The Manifesto is supportive and opens your journey to being champion 
With gratitude,
Arthur
